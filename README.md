## Overview
The Weather Monitoring System is a real-time data processing application designed to monitor weather conditions for major metros in India. It retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, processes the data to provide insights such as daily aggregates, and triggers alerts based on user-defined thresholds. This system is capable of continuous data retrieval and offers a summary of weather conditions, including average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used to implement the application.
- **Requests**: A library for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Pandas**: A data manipulation and analysis library for processing weather data.
- **dotenv**: A library to load environment variables from a `.env` file.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd weather_monitoring
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Required Libraries**
   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas python-dotenv
   ```

5. **Add Your API Key**
   - Create a file named `.env` in the project root.
   - Add your OpenWeatherMap API key to the `.env` file:
     ```plaintext
     API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**
   Execute the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python weather_monitor.py
   ```

2. **Monitor Output**
   The application will continuously fetch weather data every 5 minutes and display the weather information for the specified cities in the console.

## Functionality

- **Data Retrieval**: The system retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for the following cities:
  - Delhi
  - Mumbai
  - Chennai
  - Bangalore
  - Kolkata
  - Hyderabad

- **Temperature Conversion**: Converts temperatures from Kelvin to Celsius.

- **Daily Weather Summary**:
  - Roll up weather data and calculate:
    - Average temperature
    - Maximum temperature
    - Minimum temperature
    - Dominant weather condition

- **Alerting Thresholds**:
  - Define user-configurable thresholds for temperature.
  - Trigger alerts if weather conditions exceed defined thresholds.

- **Data Storage**: Store daily summaries and alerts (this can be expanded to include a database connection).

## Test Cases

1. **System Setup**: Verify that the application starts successfully and connects to the OpenWeatherMap API.
2. **Data Retrieval**: Simulate API calls and ensure correct parsing of weather data.
3. **Temperature Conversion**: Test the conversion of temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius.
4. **Daily Weather Summary**: Verify calculations of daily aggregates for multiple days.
5. **Alerting Thresholds**: Ensure alerts are triggered when thresholds are breached.
